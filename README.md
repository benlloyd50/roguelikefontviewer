# contributing
There are currently only fonts from sizes 5x5 to 15x15 in this repository. I am way too lazy to add the remaining ones due to poor implementation
as to how they read. So if anyone would like to contribute to something that would be. Add fonts and update the code to load in said fonts. I will
review pr's if there ever are any.
